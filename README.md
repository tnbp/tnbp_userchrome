# tnbp_userchrome
This is my userChrome.css for Firefox, after they killed customizability in Quantum.

[It looks like this.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnbp/tnbp_userchrome/master/tnbp_userchrome.png)

Features include:
* Colorful Firefox Menu button, top-left corner
* rounded tabs
* possibly more things that I forgot

I originally used someone else's userChrome.css as a template, but I can't remember where and who. If you know, please tell me--I would gladly give credit where it is due.
